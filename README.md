# Design Patterns
A small project to showcase and implement real scenarios through design patterns.

## Background
The idea of design patterns in code is not new, yet how come many of us have started coding without these in mind? or
without a proper explanation? I aim to try to explain design patterns as I would've liked someone to explain these to me.
